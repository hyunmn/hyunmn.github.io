      <p>I don’t actually use my French press to make coffee. I just use it as a jug for my pour-over.</p>

      <p>I always have coffee within an hour of waking up—it’s what really gets me going.</p>

      <p>I’ve been drinking Trader Joe’s medium roast ground coffee for over a year now.</p> 

      <p>I picked up some Stumptown coffee beans in NYC, but since I don’t have a grinder, I used my Ninja Shark blender instead. It did a decent job, maybe a bit too fine.</p>

     <a href="six.html">I often forget I’m making coffee and end up pouring the water a little late when it’s already cooling down—but it still tastes good.</a>
