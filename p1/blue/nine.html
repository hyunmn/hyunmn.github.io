    <p> <span class="word">blue</span> (2022)</p>
    <p>As you walk along the riverside, around the Fleet library of RISD, the color and design of the flags have changed. Most of them are <span class="word">blue</span> and some are black and white. The primary color of RISD has recently changed into <span class="word">blue</span>. It’s not just a light sky <span class="word">blue</span>, a strong neon <span class="word">blue</span>. I guess it’s ultramarine. When I first came here and went to the risd store, I was very happy to find out that <span class="word">blue</span> became the school color. My favorite color is <span class="word">blue</span> since I was in high school. It felt like risd was greeting me with <span class="word">blue</span> color. But people around me kept complaining to me that <span class="word">blue</span> as a school color is too boring. They told me <span class="word">blue</span> doesn’t seem like an art school, they limit the creativity in school designs, and <span class="word">blue</span> is such a common color that is used everywhere, companies, organizations, parties, etc. It’s true partly, but I was quite sad to hear all those complaints, as <span class="word">blue</span> is so special to me.</p>

    <p>Almost everyone has their own favorite colors. Having favorite colors can give special meaning to one’s ordinary life. Because just using that colored items make one’s day joyful.  Half of my stuff is <span class="word">blue</span>. When I should buy something among different color items, my choice was almost always <span class="word">blue</span>. I always end up choosing <span class="word">blue</span>. Not only does it reduce my time to choose objects but adding that to my <span class="word">blue</span> collection makes me feel happy.  For me, friends always call me a <span class="word">blue</span> girl, and on my birthday, they often gave me something related to <span class="word">blue</span>: <span class="word">blue</span> socks, a <span class="word">blue</span> shirt, a <span class="word">blue</span> notebook, <span class="word">blue</span> stickers, <span class="word">blue</span> oil colors. Some tell me they always think of me when they see something <span class="word">blue</span>. I don’t do that often these days, but I used to dress up with neon cobalt <span class="word">blue</span> shirt and sweatpants. I looked like a <span class="word">blue</span> human.</p>
      
    <p>Even though <span class="word">blue</span> is now a popular color, beloved by most of the people, it was not the same in the History. Its meaning and cultural significance has changed throughout time. While <span class="word">blue</span> was regarded as the color of barbarianism in the European society, <span class="word">blue</span> was considered a lucky color in Ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptians believed that the <span class="word">blue</span> casts out evil spirits and brings prosperity. <span class="word">Blue</span> meant the sky, the Nile, the creation, and sanctity. <span class="word">Blue</span> was also related to funeral rituals for protecting dead people. <span class="word">Blue</span> has appeared as the color of the clothes of Virgin Mary in icons since 12 centuries. It was a huge turning point of the status of <span class="word">blue</span> in the west, as the Western people had devalued <span class="word">blue</span>. <span class="word">Blue</span> clothes of Virgin Mary in icons played a major role in making <span class="word">blue</span> be the new popular color. <span class="word">Blue</span> was the most popular color among the upper class in France. The French revolution reinforced the absolute position of <span class="word">blue</span> and became one of the three colors that symbolize France. In 20 centuries, <span class="word">Blue</span> was the color of the working class. Indigo dye was used for <span class="word">blue</span> jeans, which was created as a stronger pants for working men. Nowadays, jeans symbolize the democratization of Fashion, and until now <span class="word">blue</span> is beloved by many people.</p>
      
    <p><span class="word">Blue</span> is so special because you can’t find <span class="word">blue</span> in nature. There aren’t many creatures that have a <span class="word">blue</span> color itself. Some birds and butterflies have <span class="word">blue</span> wings but still, it’s uncommon. You may think that sky is ‘<span class="word">blue</span>’, but the sky isn’t always <span class="word">blue</span>. Even the sky doesn’t have its own color. It’s the result of the scattering of light. I feel so happy when I see the <span class="word">blue</span> sky without clouds. Because unconsciously I know it’s hard to find <span class="word">blue</span>. When we look at ancient people's murals, we can’t find <span class="word">blue</span>, because they could barely get <span class="word">blue</span> pigment from nature. People used <span class="word">blue</span> in the past, but it had been quite an expensive color for a while. Ultramarine, my favorite among <span class="word">blue</span>, origins from the Latin word “Ultra(over)” and “Mare(ocean)”. It means that color came across from the ocean. The ingredient for Ultramarine was Lapis Lazuli which was imported across from the sea. It was also so complicated to make that coloring, so Ultramarine was one of the most expensive colors in the history.</p>
      
    <p>On the other hand, <span class="word">blue</span> has negative meanings. “I feel <span class="word">blue</span>” means that you are depressed. But I barely use that phrase because I feel quite odd to relate my favorite color into some negative circumstances. But I can’t deny that color <span class="word">blue</span> is the ‘cold’ tone color. I can feel the coldness and some loneliness from certain <span class="word">blue</span>s. <span class="word">Blue</span> reminds me of ice, winter, ocean. It is very different from the fact that red is related to fire, warmth, autumn, sun, and so on. The warmth is missing in <span class="word">blue</span> color. Am I a cold person? Why do I like cold <span class="word">blue</span> color so much?</p>
      
    <p>There are also some awkward situations when <span class="word">blue</span> comes up. According to a research, <span class="word">blue</span> decreases the appetite. There isn’t much restaurant where their wall or the plate color is totally vivid <span class="word">blue</span>. They often use neutral colors such as white and grey and use warm colors such as orange or yellow to increase people’s appetite. There isn’t much <span class="word">blue</span> food. Only <span class="word">blue</span> berries are <span class="word">blue</span> itself. There are some ice cream or cakes where artificial colorants are used, and <span class="word">blue</span> “Powerade” drink might seem fresh, but there isn’t much ‘<span class="word">blue</span>’ food. A friend of mine once gave me a <span class="word">blue</span> colorant for food. I tried putting those into different food: water, lemonade, ice cream, yogurt, and even rice. But it doesn’t seem like a food. <span class="word">Blue</span> food seems like a result of scientific experiment, which contaminates all the food. There wasn’t a difference of the taste of the food, but I just felt quite strange.</p>
  
    <p>Many artists used <span class="word">blue</span> for their own artworks. For example, Picasso painted <span class="word">blue</span> nude, which shows loneliness and emptiness. On the other hand, Ives Klein’s <span class="word">blue</span> nude colored with vibrant ultramarine is sensual. I think Ives Klein is the artist of <span class="word">blue</span>. He was the one who loved <span class="word">blue</span> from his heart. He thought that <span class="word">blue</span> was the most perfect color. He painted the full canvas with only <span class="word">blue</span>. He was not satisfied with the existing <span class="word">blue</span>, so he invented his own color <span class="word">blue</span> in 1960: International Klein <span class="word">Blue</span>, which is brighter and clearer. I love <span class="word">blue</span> so much that I want to paint my whole room <span class="word">blue</span> someday. But I don’t think the <span class="word">blue</span> is the perfect color for every circumstances. <span class="word">Blue</span> is beautiful and somewhat mysterious to me, but they lack some warmth and naturalism.</p>
      
    <p>As those artists loved <span class="word">blue</span>, <span class="word">blue</span> has been an important part of my artwork. I have been doing line drawing with only <span class="word">blue</span>. I did the nude painting with various colors of <span class="word">blue</span>, such as ultramarine, Prussian <span class="word">blue</span>, cobalt <span class="word">blue</span>, as an homage to some artists. I made a printing with illustrations and letters telling the history of <span class="word">blue</span>. Sometimes <span class="word">blue</span> doesn’t appear as a primary color, they are often used as a background color, for example to depict the skies, in my art works. However, for diversity of my artworks, I intentionally avoid using <span class="word">blue</span>. It could be a great character of my art, but as a student who is learning to be a great artist/designer, I should experiment with different mediums, I feel like I should not limit myself just in <span class="word">blue</span>. Trying out different things and learning different color effects seems important. In my freshman design class, I am designing an imaginary animal, “Raspberrow”. I wanted to invent a bird which loves having berries, as I love having berries, such as raspberries, <span class="word">blue</span>berries, and blackberries. But why did I end up choosing the bird whose main food source is raspberry? Because I didn’t want to make my bird ‘<span class="word">blue</span>’ again with <span class="word">blue</span>berries. I didn’t want to limit my color pallet into <span class="word">blue</span>. If I work as a professional designer in the future, I should always choose between my personal interest and the client’s taste. I should not force too much of my taste to professional projects. I should practice so that I can use different styles in different projects.</p>
      
    <p>Even though, I should try different colors, I am still going to use color <span class="word">blue</span> on my design projects. When I go to the bookstore or exhibitions, I can find many designs which are using <span class="word">blue</span>. <span class="word">Blue</span> is often used with color white, so that it can emphasize the <span class="word">blue</span>. It has clean but strong impact. What can I do to make my <span class="word">blue</span> design different from others? Before to make final <span class="word">blue</span> project, I think I should try out as much as I can with <span class="word">blue</span>s. Using different art mediums like pen, colored pencils, oil pastel, watercolor, acrylic color etc. Differentiate the weight and value of the <span class="word">blue</span> lines, drawing different subjects just with <span class="word">blue</span>, trying out how many <span class="word">blue</span> colors I can make, using <span class="word">blue</span> for primary color or for substitute colors, thinking about the relationship of <span class="word">blue</span> with other colors are things that I can do.  I will start those from today.</p>
    
    <p>I don’t know when until the <span class="word">blue</span> would be my favorite color. It might change into green or grey someday. But still, I love <span class="word">blue</span>, and I am so happy to find <span class="word">blue</span> objects in my everyday life. Just using <span class="word">blue</span> pen on the <span class="word">blue</span> notebook makes me feel special. I feel like something great would happen. After finishing this essay, I will wear my <span class="word">blue</span> jacket, take my <span class="word">blue</span> pen, and start doodling while enjoying the sun under the <span class="word">blue</span> sky.</p>
