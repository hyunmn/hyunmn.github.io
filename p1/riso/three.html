  <p style="width:30%; position: absolute; right:20px; top:20px; ">Risograph printing starts by scanning an image and creating a stencil on a thermal plate. Ink is pushed through the stencil onto paper as it moves through a rotating drum, allowing for fast printing. For multi-color prints, the paper is run through the machine multiple times, creating slight variations and a unique look. Riso uses bright, vibrant inks, giving prints a distinct texture and aesthetic, unlike standard CMYK printing.  <br><br><a href="four.html">Check out my riso work!</a></p>
